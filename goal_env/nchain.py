    """n-Chain environment
    This game presents moves along a linear chain of states, with two actions:
     0) forward, which moves along the chain but returns no reward
     1) backward, which returns to the beginning and has a small reward
    The end of the chain, however, presents a large reward, and by moving
    'forward' at the end of the chain this large reward can be repeated.
    At each action, there is a small probability that the agent 'slips' and the
    opposite transition is instead taken.
    The observed state is the current state in the chain (0 to n-1).
    This environment is described in section 6.1 of:
    A Bayesian Framework for Reinforcement Learning by Malcolm Strens (2000)
